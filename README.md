Use the various list commands to display the syllabus codes for the classes. For example If I wanted to download AS and A level biology, I would first run:

```python
python main.py -LA
```

to list the As and A level classes, and see that Biology has the syllabus number 9700.

I would then run the following to download it:

```
python main.py -A 9700
```

The help command on the argument parser displays each command in detail:
```bash
usage: main.py [-h] [-A AICE] [-O ORDINARY] [-I IGCSE] [-LA] [-LO] [-LI]
